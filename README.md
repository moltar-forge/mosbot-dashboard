The **UI layer** of [MosBot OS](https://github.com/bymosbot/mosbot-api) — a self-hosted operating system for AI agent work.

MosBot Dashboard is a React 18 + Vite SPA that provides task management, org chart visualization, workspace browsing, and agent monitoring. It consumes the [MosBot API](https://github.com/bymosbot/mosbot-api) backend.

> **Disclaimer:** MosBot OS is vibe-coded with minimal actual code reviews. It is currently used for personal usage only.

## Known bugs / pending fixes

- **Create new agent** — Not working. Do not use.
- **Config update** — May not be as reliable due to REDACTIONS. Prefer using OpenClaw's ControlUI instead.

## TODO

- [ ] Fix the known issues above.
- [ ] Org chart: reference OpenClaw agents list and org-chart JSON file for supplementary metadata.
- [x] Workspace file viewer: display JSON frontmatter.
- [ ] Workspace file viewer: display other file types instead of just Markdown (e.g. `.jpg`, `.wav` audio player, `.js` with proper syntax highlighting, etc.).
- [ ] Increase code coverage to 100% for Dashboard.

## Features

- **Agent Monitor** — view active sessions, costs, and usage analytics
- **Task Board** — drag-and-drop task management with priorities, tags, and dependencies
- **Standups** — daily AI-generated standup summaries
- **Org Chart** — live visualization of AI agents with real-time session status
- **Workspaces** — browse and edit agent workspace files
- **Scheduler** — schedule and monitor recurring agent tasks
- **Users** — role-based access (owner, admin, agent, user)

## Quickstart

The recommended way to run the full stack is via Docker Compose in the `mosbot-api` repo:

cd mosbot-api
cp .env.example .env   # edit required values
make up
```

Dashboard will be available at **http://localhost:5173**.

### Dashboard-only dev server

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # set VITE_API_URL to your running API

```

## Available commands

```bash
make dev        # start Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
make lint       # run ESLint
make test-run   # run tests once (CI mode)
make build      # build for production (output: dist/)
```
